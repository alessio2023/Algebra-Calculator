The code begins by defining the equation to be solved. This involves defining the symbolic variables and their relationships.
**The code that is triggered with this question is:**

     try
            % Determine the type of problem
            if contains(problem, 'plot')
                % Graph the function
                graph_function(problem);
            elseif contains(problem, '==') && contains(problem, '[') && contains(problem, ']')
                % Solve the system of equations
                solve_system(problem);
            elseif contains(problem, '=')
                % Solve the equation
                solve_equation(problem);
            else
                disp('Unsupported problem type. Please enter a valid algebraic problem.');
            end
            
**When the code is asked to solve a normal equation regarding x and y, then it triggers this line of code:**

    function solve_equation(equation)
    disp(['Solving the equation: ', equation]);
    
    
    try
        % Find the '=' sign and split the equation
        equalSignIdx = strfind(equation, '=');
        if isempty(equalSignIdx)
            error('The equation must contain an "=" sign.');
        end
        
        lhs = equation(1:equalSignIdx-1);
        rhs = equation(equalSignIdx+1:end);
        
        % Convert to symbolic expressions
        syms x;
        lhsSym = str2sym(lhs);
        rhsSym = str2sym(rhs);
        
        % Solve the equation
        solution = solve(lhsSym == rhsSym, x);
        
        % Display the steps and the solution
        disp('Step-by-step solution:');
        disp('1. Convert the equation to symbolic form.');
        disp(['   LHS: ', char(lhsSym)]);
        disp(['   RHS: ', char(rhsSym)]);
        disp('2. Solve the equation.');
        disp(['   Solution: x = ', char(solution)]);
    catch ME
        disp(['Error while solving the equation: ', ME.message]);
    end
end
